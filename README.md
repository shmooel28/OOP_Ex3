# OOP Assignment 3
--
The mission was to write a Data Structure and algorithm on graph(directed and Weighted).

About the mission:
--
Graph is very important tool for programmer, graph can use in many problem such as Social Network, and Roads. you can see also in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics).

Algorithms

shortestPath: i use Dijkstra algorithm. the idea behind the algorithm, if from point a to point b, is faster to go from a to point c and than to point b, replace the path from a to b in a-c-b. you can see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm

center: after i have the shortest path dist it was triviali, i just check the farest node with the smallest width and return that node https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_center

tsp: i used in greedy algorithm, every time look for the short path dist.
