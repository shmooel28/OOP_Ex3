# OOP Assignment 3
--
The mission was to write a Data Structure and algorithm on graph(directed and Weighted) on python.

About the mission:
--
Graph is very important tool for programmer, graph can use in many problem such as Social Network, and Roads. you can see also in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics).

Algorithms
--

shortestPath: i use Dijkstra algorithm. the idea behind the algorithm, if from point a to point b, is faster to go from a to point c and than to point b, replace the path from a to b in a-c-b. you can see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

center: using Dijkstra algorithm, i check the biggest dist for every node, and then the center is the min between all the dist,for reading more about center- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_center

tsp: i used in greedy algorithm, every time i take the min distance between two point in the cities list.
